## This is a set of basic scripts for analyzing genomic data, particularly rearrangements.
Scripts do not include novel algorthms or applications, but are developed to mediate analysis workflows using other freely-available software.

Scripts are mostly written in Perl, though probably not that well. All include their own documentation, accessible by passing no parameters.

### Included Analysis Workflows:  
As described in __Weigand *et al.* 2016__  
1. __WORKFLOW-REARRANGEMENTS.md__: Characterize genome rearrangements in complete assemblies.
1. __WORKFLOW-IS481.md__: Match variable IS481 insertions in a set of genomes.
